A Tale of Soaring Profits: End-to-end airline analytics project using advanced statistical modeling, NLP sentiment scoring, and multivariate analysis to uncover high-impact business levers. Features MICE imputation with LightGBM, PCA/MCA, and hypothesis testing across 1,200+ variable combinations. 

# A Tale of Soaring Profits: How Data Lights the Path

## Project Overview
This project, presented by Gajarajan V Y, demonstrates a data-driven approach to enhance profitability, customer retention, and operational efficiency in the airline industry.

## Executive Summary
**Objective:** Generate actionable insights to enhance profitability, customer retention, and operational efficiency.

**Analytical Approach:**
- Data Cleaning: Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) using LightGBM
- Sentiment Scoring: Natural Language Processing on customer feedback
- Hypothesis Testing: Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney U, Chi-Square for independence
- Statistical Modeling: Linear regression; association strength via Cramér’s V
- Multivariate Analysis: Principal Component Analysis (PCA); Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA)

**Scope of Analysis:**
1. Examined ~1,200 bivariate and multivariate variable combinations
2. Bivariate Findings:
   - 25 significant numerical-numerical relationships
   - 40 significant numerical-categorical relationships
   - 14 significant categorical-categorical relationships
   - 4 significant time-metric relationships
3. Multivariate Findings: 54 statistically significant patterns

## Key Outcomes
- Identified the top five insights with the strongest statistical support, practical relevance, and clear interpretability:
  - **Customer Retention Risk:** +255% profit per 1% risk increase, -223% costs
  - **High-Tier Customers:** ~40% higher revenue, ~12% cost savings
  - **Customer Sentiment:** +39.56% conversion gains, boosted revenue
  - **Influential Merchants/Regions:** 32.82% higher route dynamics
  - **Flight Operations/Pricing:** 29.52% complexity cut, 22.12% pricing agility, 12.01% booking lift

## Strategic Initiatives
1. **Retention:** Pilot target high-risk, high-value customers
2. **Upsell & Expand:** Focus on premium tiers and flagship routes
3. **Streamline Ops:** Implement dynamic pricing and simplify schedules

## 9-Month Rollout Plan
- **Months 1-2:** Setup and prepare all customer, route, and operational data
- **Months 3-4:** Pilot retention and sentiment programs for high-risk customers
- **Months 5-6:** Pilot upsell campaigns and expand capacity on flagship routes
- **Months 7-8:** Pilot operational streamlining and A/B test dynamic pricing
- **Month 9:** Assess pilot results and plan for a full enterprise rollout
